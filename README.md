This is the repository for the Next.js App Router Course.

I learned feature by feature thanks to Next.js team that develop this excellent course for beginners

This course contains these features like:

- File based routing as `/static` and `/[dynamic]` pages and encapsulated `(overview)` route
- How to use `Layout` and navigate between pages
- `Static` and `Dynamic` rendering
- Setting up data base on `SQL` with Vercel and how to fetch data on `Next` app
- Streaming
- Partial `Prerendering`
- Handling errors by `error.tsx` and `not-found.tsx`, handling loadings by `loading.tsx`
- Authentication
- Improving Accessibility and Metadata
